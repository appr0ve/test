This is README file for rdb client.
rdb client interact with ALTRepo API[1].

Notice for end users:
This program developed only for demonstrative purpose.

Prerequisites

Before start building install followed dependencies:
> apt-get install -y gcc-10 make glib2-devel libjson-devel libgio-devel

Additional dependencies:
> apt-get install -y gettext-tools

Notice on compiler selection:
Simply Linux have broken symlink to gcc-10 [BUG].
We using hardcode link to executable in Makefile.

After that get source code for program from github repo:
> git clone https://github.com/appr0ve/test
or (you can change wget on somebody else)
> wget https://github.com/appr0ve/test/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
> tar xf main.tar.gz

Building

We are assign followed two binary targets (rdb and librdb.so):
- rdb
  Client with command line interface without interative mode.
- librdb.so
  Shared library for using with rdb client.

Installation proccess starting by `install` target.
Read more in `Installation` section below.

Other targets:
- clean
  Remove binary targets.
- po_*
  Localization related files.

Installation

By default installation perform to /opt directory[2].

If you prefer another destination change shell enviroment:
> PREFIX=$MY_PREFER_DIR make install

Localization

First you are need get fresh template:
> make po_template

If you prefer add new translation get follow:
> lang=$PREFER_LANG make po_init
Notice: $PREFER_LANG must be ISO 639-1 encoded.
You can try get your code by this:
> echo $LANG | cut -b 1,2

In another way after refresh template apply new changes:
> lang=$PREFER_LANG make po_update

If you are job done, upgrade locale file:
> lang=$PREFER_LANG make po_mo
